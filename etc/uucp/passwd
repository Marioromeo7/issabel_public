# This is an example of a passwd file. This file is syntax compatible
# with Taylor UUCP (not HDB, not anything else). Please check uucp
# documentation if you are not sure how to configure Taylor UUCP config files.
# Edit the file as appropriate for your system, there are sample files
# in /usr/share/doc/uucp/sample

# Everything after a '#' character is a comment.
